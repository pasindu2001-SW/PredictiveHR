## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- Python (v3.8 or higher)
- PostgreSQL (v12 or higher)
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NavvAbhishek/PredictiveHR.git
   cd PredictiveHR
   ```

2. **Set up the database**
   - Create a PostgreSQL database
   - Note down your database credentials

3. **Configure environment variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```env
   DB_USER=your_database_user
   DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_PORT=5432
   DB_NAME=your_database_name
   SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to frontend directory**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

### Backend Setup

1. **Navigate to backend directory**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Start the backend server**
   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

## 📊 Model Training

The system uses a Logistic Regression model trained on employee data to predict churn probability. The model considers various factors such as:

- Job satisfaction metrics
- Work-life balance indicators
- Career progression data
- Compensation analysis
- Geographic and remote work factors

## 🔧 Usage

1. **Data Input**: Upload employee data or input individual employee metrics
2. **Prediction**: Get churn probability scores for employees
3. **Analytics**: View detailed insights and trends
4. **Export**: Download reports and predictions for further analysis
